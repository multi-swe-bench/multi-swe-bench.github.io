                <h3>Reasoning Traces</h3>
                <p>
                    (07/29/2024) We have updated the SWE-bench leaderboard submission criteria to require the inclusion of <i>reasoning traces</i>.
                    The goal of this requirement is to provide the community with more insight into how cutting edge methods work without requiring a code release (although the latter is still highly encouraged!).
                </p>
                <p><b>What is a reasoning trace?</b></p>
                <p>
                    A reasoning trace is a text-based file that describes the steps your system took to solve a task instance.
                    It should provide a detailed account of the reasoning process that your system used to arrive at its solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We purposely do not explicitly define reasoning traces in a strict, explicit format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do have some guidelines. the reasoning trace should be...
                    <ul>
                        <li>Human-readable.</li>
                        <li>Reflects the intermediate steps your system took that led to the final solution.</li>
                        <li>Generated <i>with</i> the inference process, not post-hoc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not require reasoning traces to be...
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a specific file format (e.g. <code>json</code>, <code>yaml</code>, <code>md</code>)</li>
                        <li>Conform to a specific problem solving style (e.g. agentic, procedural, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A simple solution to this? When running inference, simply log the intermediate output generated by your system.
                    For an example, see <a href="https://github.com/swe-bench/experiments/tree/main/evaluation/lite/20240402_sweagent_gpt4/logs">SWE-agent + GPT-4 Turbo Trajectories</a>.
                    In short, our requirements for what a reasoning trace should specific look like are non-specific.
                    We trust you to provide a detailed account of how your system solved the task instance.
                </p>
                <p><b>Why are we requiring it?</b></p>
                <p>
                    We believe that reasoning traces can provide valuable insights into how cutting edge methods work without requiring a code release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of this post (7/29/2024), we have received many submissions that have pushed the state of the art on SWE-bench, which is exciting to see!
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we have also found that the top-performing submissions to SWE-bench typically have not open sourced their code nor been verified.
                    We recognize that some leaderboard participants (1) would like to add an entry to SWE-bench but (2) do not want to release their code or proprietary system, which is completely understandable.
                    On the other hand, given that open source systems submitted to SWE-bench have propelled the development of closed-source participants, we would like to continuing promoting development on SWE-bench as a community-level collaborative process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we believe that providing reasoning traces serves as a valuable compromise between these two groups.
                </p>
                <p><b>What should I submit?</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a <code>trajs/</code> folder in your submission directory.</li>
                    <li>Within this folder, upload a reasoning trace per task instance that your system generated a prediction for.</li>
                    <li>Make sure the naming convention of the reasoning trace file reflects the SWE-bench task instance it corresponds to. (e.g. <code>astropy__astropy-1234.md</code>)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We will review the reasoning traces you submit.
                    We plan to only accept submissions with reasoning traces for the SWE-bench leaderboard.
